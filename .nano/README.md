# Syntax highlighting files for the [GNU/Nano editor](https://nano-editor.org/)

This repository contains some manually written syntax highlighting files for the [GNU/Nano editor](https://nano-editor.org/).

Some files also come from the default Nano installation.

## Install with git :wrench:
Be sure you don't have a directory `~/.nano` and no file `~/.nanorc`.

Then, clone the repository and symlink the config file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naereen/nanorc.git ~/.nano/
ln -s ~/.nano/.nanorc ~/.nanorc
```

You can try to check if the installation went well by opening the `~/.nanorc` file.

```bash
nano  ~/.nanorc  # should be nicely colored!
```

> **Warning**: clearly, this will only work on GNU/Linux. And I only tested it on Ubuntu...

## Install manually
You can download and install any of the `LANGUAGEXXX.nanorc` files, where you wish, and be sure that your `~/.nanorc` file include the files you want, with this syntax:

```python
# Coloration for nanorc, from https://github.com/Naereen/nanorc
include "~/.nano/nanorc.nanorc"
```

## Remark
I am no longer an intense user of GNU/Nano so most of the files date from 2012, 2013 and 2014.
But I still use it, and I test all of them on each new release of the editor, they still work well as fuck.
Enjoy!
