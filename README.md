# dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles that I use in my bash.

## List of programs needed:
```
- alacritty
- curl
- df
- i3
- nano
- neofetch
- pacman
- picom
- polybar
- yay
```

## I3 bindings for:
```
- amixer (alsa)
- brightnessctl
- maim
- nitrogen
- picom
- redshift
- xclip
```

## flavoured-os-additions included in these files
- adjust volume by using FN+Keys (-c 1 is included because I use another audio channel)
- control brightness by using FN+Keys
- desktop background at startup
- polybar instead of the default i3 bar
- redshift to protect your eyes
- remove the application name bar, add a border to the active window
- screenshots by pressing various keyboard shortcuts
- window compositor: transparent windows

## Why did you share this stuff?
Since configuring and searching for all this stuff took me so much time I leave it here, as it can be useful to me and others.

It is used in my Arch Linux script: https://github.com/dag7dev/magic-startup-arch-sh
